## 📱 Epic 1: Adaptive Device Detection & Responsive Layouts

### Epic Summary

Automatically detect the user's device type (desktop, tablet, mobile) and screen orientation to provide an optimized layout. This ensures field providers on mobile get a touch-first, one-handed experience while administrators on desktops see a productivity-focused, data-rich interface.

### Business Value

- **Reduced friction** for mobile users (80% of field providers)
- **Increased engagement** through device-appropriate UX
- **Lower support requests** from confused users

### Acceptance Criteria

1. System auto-detects device type on app load
2. Layout adapts in real-time to screen resize/orientation change
3. Mobile layout prioritizes:
   - Large tap targets (min 48px)
   - Bottom-sheet modals (thumb-reachable)
   - Swipe gestures for common actions
4. Desktop layout prioritizes:
   - Data density (more info visible)
   - Sidebar navigation (always visible)
   - Keyboard shortcuts
5. User can manually override device mode in Settings

- [x] Re-evaluate on window resize or orientation change

**Technical Notes:**

```typescript
// src/contexts/DeviceContext.tsx
type DeviceType = 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop'
type Orientation = 'portrait' | 'landscape'

interface DeviceState {
  device: DeviceType
  orientation: Orientation

## � Epic 4: Battle-Ready PWA (Offline & Sync)

### Epic Summary

Empower field providers to operate seamlessly in disconnected environments (DIL - Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited bandwidth). The app must function 100% offline for data entry and reviewing cached data, synchronizing automatically when connectivity is restored.

### Business Value

- **Mission Criticality**: Field medics often operate in signal-dead zones.
- **Data Integrity**: No lost notes due to connection drops.
- **Speed**: Local-first architecture makes the UI instant (0ms latency).

### Acceptance Criteria

1. App loads instantly in Airplane Mode.
2. Users can create, edit, and archive notes while offline.
3. "Pending Sync" indicator shows for unsynced data.
4. Background sync handles data upload when connection returns.
5. Conflict resolution strategy defined (Last-Write-Wins or Manual Merge).

### User Story 4.1: Service Worker Caching Strategy

**As a** provider in a bunker with no signal,
**I want** the app shell and recent data to load immediately,
**So that** I maintain situational awareness without internet.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Implement Workbox for advanced caching strategies.
- [x] Logic:
  - **Stale-While-Revalidate** for static assets (icons, stylesheets).
  - **Network-First** for list views (Encounter Logs).
  - **Cache-First** for "Immutable" resources (Profile pictures, Forms).
- [x] "You are offline" banner notification.

**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Sprint:** 9
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### User Story 4.2: Robust Offline Write Queue (Outbox Pattern)

**As a** provider documenting a casualty,
**I want** to hit "Save" regardless of connection status,
**So that** I can move to the next patient immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Create persistent local "Mutation Queue" (IndexedDB).
- [x] All write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) go to Queue first.
- [x] "Sync Engine" processes queue when online.
- [x] Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed syncs.

**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## 🛡️ Epic 5: Fortified Security (Zero Trust)

### Epic Summary

Elevate security posture to meet strict DoD impact levels. Implement "Zero Trust" principles on the client side, ensuring data is encrypted at rest in the browser and authentication is resistant to session hijacking.

### User Story 5.1: Biometric Re-Authentication

**As a** provider sharing a tablet,
**I want** to use FaceID/TouchID to unlock the app after inactivity,
**So that** I don't have to type my long password repeatedly while ensuring security.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Implement WebAuthn API.
- [x] "Unlock" screen overlays app after 5 mins inactivity.
- [x] Fallback to PIN/Password if biometrics fail.

**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### User Story 5.2: Client-Side Data Encryption

**As a** security officer,
**I want** sensitive local data (IndexedDB/LocalStorage) to be encrypted,
**So that** physical device theft doesn't compromise patient data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Encrypt all "Rest" data in IndexedDB (AES-GCM).
- [x] Encryption key derived from user session (not stored plain text).
- [x] Clear sensitive data on explicit logout.

---

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation "Shortfalls"

### 1. Offline Data Conflict

- **Risk**: Provider A edits a note offline. Admin B edits same note online. Provider A reconnects.
- **Impact**: Data loss or overwrite.
- **Mitigation**: Implement "Field Level LWW" (Last Write Wins) or visual diff merge. For MVP, Field Provider wins.

### 2. Local Storage Limits

- **Risk**: Browser creates quota limit (usually ~50-100MB) for PWA.
- **Impact**: App fails to cache media/charts.
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy for cached assets. Monitor `navigator.storage.estimate()`.

### 3. Session Expiry in Field

- **Risk**: Auth token expires while offline.
- **Impact**: User locked out until connectivity returns.
- **Mitigation**: Implement long-lived "Refresh Tokens" that can be rotated. Allow "Offline Session" mode (read-only) if token expired but biometric check passes.
