## 🔴 Critical Gaps for Enterprise Quality

### 1. **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) - CRITICAL**
**Current State:** ~40% compliant  
**Enterprise Standard:** 100% WCAG 2.1 AA (DoD/VA mandate)

**Missing Elements:**
- [ ] `aria-label` on all buttons, links, inputs
- [ ] `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
- [ ] Skip-to-main-content link
- [ ] Focus management after modal close
- [ ] Form field error announcements
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy audit (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [ ] Color contrast audit (some grays may fail 4.5:1)
- [ ] Touch target size audit (min 44x44px)

**Recommendation:** Dedicate Sprint 10 to accessibility hardening.

---

### 2. **Automated Communications - HIGH**
**Current State:** None  
**Enterprise Standard:** SMS/Email reminders reduce no-shows by 30-40%

**Missing Elements:**
- [ ] Appointment reminder 24h before
- [ ] Appointment reminder 1h before
- [ ] Cancellation confirmation
- [ ] Waitlist slot opened notification (Fast Pass)
- [ ] Post-visit feedback request

**Recommendation:** Implement via Supabase Edge Functions + Email provider.

---

### 3. **Patient Pre-Visit Workflow - MEDIUM-HIGH**
**Current State:** Basic booking only  
**Enterprise Standard:** Digital intake, e-check-in, pre-visit questionnaire

**Missing Elements:**
- [ ] Pre-visit notes field (patient can add)
- [ ] Insurance verification step (placeholder for military)
- [ ] Demographics confirmation
- [ ] Pre-appointment checklist

**Recommendation:** Add to Member booking flow.

---

### 4. **Security Hardening - MEDIUM**
**Current State:** Token-based auth, PIN, RLS  
**Enterprise Standard:** HIPAA-compliant data handling

**Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- ✅ Token anonymity (Zero PHI design)
- ✅ PIN-based device security
- ✅ Session timeout (15 min member / shift-aware provider)
- ✅ Audit logging table exists

**Gaps:**
- [ ] Client-side encryption for IndexedDB/localStorage
- [ ] Failed login attempt lockout (implemented but not visible)
- [ ] Session activity logging (detailed)
- [ ] Data export audit trail
- [ ] Explicit BAA documentation readiness

---

## ✅ What We're Doing Right (Industry-Leading)

| Feature | Comparison |
|---------|------------|
| **Anonymous Token System** | Exceeds typical patient identification (Zero PHI) |
| **Mobile-First Responsive Design** | Matches Epic MyChart mobile app |
| **Waitlist Management** | On par with Epic Fast Pass concept |
| **Provider Schedule Generation** | Comparable to Cerner bulk scheduling |
| **Visual Appointment Cards** | Premium UX, exceeds basic systems |
| **Offline PWA Shell** | Service worker caching implemented |
| **Real-Time Countdown** | Premium feature not in most portals |
